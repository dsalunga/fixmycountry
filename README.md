The project aims to make a better world by finding the truth in all aspect of knowledge and document them in a way that is easy to find and understand by everyone. It aims to do this by finding the truth using a honest intent, sound judgement, critical thinking, a set of system mechanics that prevent chaotic discussions, and the collective effort of everyone wanting to find the truth.

This is an open research and an attempt to collect all verifiable facts and open them to everyone to contribute, challenge and come up with all sorts of doubts they can think of. Eventually, we can come up with a "golden source" which is a collection of truth that survived all the possible arguments from anyone, hardened by all the challenges and supported by all available evidences.

This project does not intend to replace Wikipedia or other crowded-sourced encyclopedia or similar internet sites, but to provide a place where everyone can go when they are looking for not just random information but for the truth out of the various information they see in the internet, from the news, from people around them, and from various sources.

If someone wanted to find information about different topics or explore the vast information from the internet, there is Wikipedia and Google, but to see what is really the truth, then this is where they can go.

General Assumptions
* A lot of people are having difficulty to find true information and difficulty to determine which one to believe.
* The world will be a better place if people will know the real truth and can easily find it, and distinguish it from random claims and opinions.
* There is lots of information in the world, truth and lies lying around and intertwined together. People cannot easily differentiate between truth and lie because information is highly unorganized and a lot is unverifiable especially in the internet.
* If we can have a place where truth and lies are clearly organized, categories and distinctly separated, then people will easily see the truth and will know what is a lie.
* If people knows the truth, there will be less war in the world, less disagreements, better governance and politics, better education system, only one religion, better environment, better relationship between humans, better health, more love and there will be peace.

General Characteristics of most Discussions and Internet Forums
* Mostly single-sided, controlled by users with admin privileges or by the majority
* Citing unverified or unverifiable sources
* Chaotic, unorganized or uncontrollable
* Ends with disagreements and often offensive and discriminatory in nature
* Cyclic, with looping arguments, never-ending (check some Creationist vs Evolutionist discussions)
* Vital points get buried in comments
* Non-sense comments often prevail due to numbers
* Truth is hard to find
