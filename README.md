# wikitruth

The project aims to make a better world by finding the truth in all aspect of knowledge and document them in a way that is easy to find and understand by everyone. It aims to do this by finding the truth using a honest intent, sound judgement, critical thinking, a set of system mechanics that prevent chaotic discussions, and the collective effort of everyone wanting to find the truth.

This is an open research and an attempt to collect all verifiable facts and open them to everyone to contribute, challenge and come up with all sorts of doubts they can think of. Eventually, we can come up with a "golden source" which is a collection of truth that survived all the possible arguments from anyone, hardened by all the challenges and supported by all available evidences.

This project does not intend to replace Wikipedia or other crowded-sourced encyclopedia or similar internet sites, but to provide a place where everyone can go when they are looking for not just random information but for the truth out of the various information they see in the internet, from the news, from people around them, and from various sources.

If someone wanted to find information about different topics or explore the vast information from the internet, there is Wikipedia and Google, but to see what is really the truth, then this is where they can go.
